 MMogPad

    Disclaimer: I am new to doing write-ups of projects so please let me know if there is any information you would like to know that I have not included here- Let me know!

This project started as a response to seeing the HorixFFXIV game-pad collaboration. It seemed like an interesting concept but there were a few things I didn't like. 

 1. The 'ergonomic' design: I'm sure that for many people this design is really nice for their hands. For me though- the design feels terrible. and if I'm honest I don't need so many buttons. 
 2. Price:  I am NOT paying 140$ for an oversized macro-pad with joystick. 
 3. Aesthetic: it is very 'gamer'-y and to be honest I don't find that to be very appealing- that said it is also HUGE. I don't want most of my limited desk space to be taken up by some ugly giant macropad. 
 4. Its not pink. 
So the first thing i needed was a Macro-pad. For this i got a dumbpad by Keedb. Originally I had gotten six kits to make some for myself and friends as holiday gifts.
